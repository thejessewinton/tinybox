# tinylight ðŸŽ‰

## This package is a work in progress!
---
tinylight is a tiny, fast, and unopinionated lightbox component for React projects.

tinylight comes as a set of component primitives that you can use to build your own lightbox. It handles the heavy lifting of state management, so you can focus on user experience.

## Story

If you have any suggestions or issues, please open an issue or a PR! I'd love to get feedback from others who are looking to solve the same problem.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make the primitives headless.
- [ ] Allow for multiple lightboxes on the same page.
- [ ] Make all the components fully accessible.
- [ ] Add component primitives to handle video components.
- [ ] Add component primitives to handle iframe components, with automatic rendering based on the provider, passed in via URL.
