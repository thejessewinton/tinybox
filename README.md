# tinylight ðŸŽ‰

---

tinylight is a set of beautifully designed, accessible components for building lightboxes in React. Built on top of Radix primitives, tinylight is a collection of beautiully designed, accessible components: `Lightbox` is in beta, and a `Video` component is in the works.

View the docs [here](https://tinylight.jessewinton.works).


## Roadmap

Once the Lightbox component is stable, I'll continue working on a Video component. I'm also looking into way to make the Lightbox component more customizable, and I'm open to suggestions and contributions!
