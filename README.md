## This package is a work in progress!
---

tinylight is a tiny, ustyled, unopinionated lightbox component for React projects, built as a set of lightweight primitives. The primitives handle the heavy lifting of state management, letting you focus on other, more important parts of your project. If you have any suggestions as I'm developing, please open an issue or a PR! I'd love to get feedback from other devs who have encountered similar issues.

## In Progress
- [x] Basic lightbox functionality
- [ ] Pagination Components 
- [ ] Thumbnail Navigation
- [ ] 
## Roadmap
- [ ] Make the primitives headless.
- [ ] Allow for multiple lightboxes on the same page.
- [ ] Make all the components fully accessible.
- [ ] Add component primitives to handle video components.
- [ ] Add component primitives to handle iframe components for external video providers.
