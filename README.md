## This package is a work in progress!

Tinybox is a tiny, fast, and unopinionated lightbox component for React projects.

Tinybox comes as a set of component primitives that you can use to build your own lightbox. It handles the heavy lifting of state managment, so you can focus on user experience.

## Story

While working on a project I found that there were no good, simple, unopinionated lightbox components for React. So I built Tinybox. It's a work-in-progress, so if you have any suggestions or issues, please open an issue or a PR.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make the primitives headless.
