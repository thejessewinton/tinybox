# tinybox

## This is a work in progress

Tinybox is a tiny, fast, and unopinionated lightbox component for React projects.

The key features of Tinybox are:

- Tiny: 1.5kb gzipped
- Fast: 60fps on mobile
- Unopinionated: Tinybox comes as a set of component primitives that you can use to build your own lightbox. All this handles is state and the navigation between components.

Built with:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/)

## Story

While working on a project I found that there were no good, simple, unopinionated lightbox components for React. So I built Tinybox. It's a work-in-progress, so if you have any suggestions or issues, please open an issue or a PR.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install tinybox
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Add support for custom components
- [x] Add support for custom animations
- [ ] Make the components headless, and allow this to be used in other frameworks
