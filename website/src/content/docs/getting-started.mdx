title: Lightbox
description: Advanced code blocks with highlighting, file names and more.

> **Please note that tinylight is currently in a very early beta stage.** It is not recommended for use in production quite yet, but will be ready within the next few weeks. Also, please note that the API will change slightly before the final release.

# What this is

The core principle behind tinylight has take a lot of inspiration from libraries like [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com) or [Radix](https://radix-ui.com). I'm a big fan of both, and I wanted to create something similar for components that I've found are less often considered. Right now, that means lightboxes, but the idea is to expand this to some other components as well, and the roadmap includes an oEmbed container for custom Vimeo and YouTube players, with hooks to customize controls, and HTML video and audio components.

## Installation

First, install tinylight using your package manager of choice.

```bash title="pnpm (recommended)"
pnpm install tinylight
```

```bash title="yarn"
yarn install tinylight
```

```bash title="npm"
npm install tinylight
```

Then, import it into your component:

```tsx
import { Lightbox } from "tinylight";
```

And build away!

## Usage

I'm in process of building out more detailed examples, but in the meantime here is a fully-functional, but unstyled, version of the component with all currently stable features.

Note, that the API has changed a bit; you should now manage the open and closed state of the lightbox within your application.

```tsx title="Lightbox.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import { Lightbox } from "tinylight";

const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

const handleOpen = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

return (
  <>
    <button onClick={handleOpen}>Open Lightbox</button>
    <Lightbox open={isOpen}>
      <button onClick={handleOpen} className="relative z-20">
        Close
      </button>
      <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 backdrop-blur" />
      <div className="fixed inset-0 flex h-full flex-col items-center justify-center">
        <Lightbox.Items className="relative z-20">
          {items.map((item) => (
            <Image
              key={item.src}
              src={item.src}
              alt={item.alt}
              width={800}
              height={600}
            />
          ))}
        </Lightbox.Items>

        <div className="relative z-20 flex flex-col gap-4">
          <nav className="flex w-full justify-between gap-4">
            <Lightbox.Nav>
              {({ toPrev, toNext }) => (
                <>
                  <button onClick={toPrev}>Prev</button>
                  <button onClick={toNext}>Next</button>
                </>
              )}
            </Lightbox.Nav>
          </nav>

          <Lightbox.Pagination>
            {({ activeItem, itemsCount }) => (
              <>
                {activeItem} / {itemsCount}
              </>
            )}
          </Lightbox.Pagination>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Lightbox>
  </>
);
```
